        <div class="title">Your mission seems important, but what about this other cause?</div>
        <p>We've crafted our measurements carefully in an attempt to create a functioning representative democracy. The individuals involved in Every Two Years believe in far more than just these points, but believe citizens can drive that change when given a functioning government.</p>
        <p>A good example of this is civil rights. We are avid civil rights supporters but believe progress on civil rights has been thwarted by illegal activity in our government. Our government has actively worked to undermine civil rights movements. We consider civilian oversight of our government, through the process of a functioning representative democracy, to be on the critical path for making meaningful progress on civil rights.</p>

        <div class="title">You have an X for a candidate but their opponent is terrible!</div>
        <p>You may be right that their opponent is terrible. They may not earn a green check mark in any of the three categories either. But it isn't about trying to pick the best option given to us by a broken system, it's about using the power we have to apply pressure to our representatives. This election cycle we are going to encourage you to vote this candidate out of office. If we succeed, then the next election cycle we are going to vote their replacement out too unless they measure up.</p>
        <p>It's about sending a clear message: we will take away your power if you don't restore civilian oversight of our government.</p>
